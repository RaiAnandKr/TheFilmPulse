Single-database configuration for Flask.
For generating the migration script and commit it in github,

// You would use the below to do local testing for the backend anyway.
docker-compose --file dev-compose.yml up

// Make the changes in models.py
// The change will be reflected inside the backend container automatically
// because the backend directory is mounted as a volume

// Now run the following to generate the migration script
docker-compose -f dev-compose.yml exec backend flask db migrate
--directory=/app/backend/migrations -m "Add end_date to Opinion and Prediction"

// The migration script will be updated in your local git repo as well because
// the backend directory is mounted as a volume.
// Commit the changes in backend/migrations folder.

// The new deployment will run a 'flask db upgrade' and update the DB.
